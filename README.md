### Hello Awesome people

ðŸ”­ I'm a full stack developer with lots of interest in Javascript, Typescript, Python, AWS and Node.js.

:octocat: I do some cool projects and play chess in my free time.ðŸŒ± I am building a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtHXEeVll9qd6ELW27Jc7nA) where I talk about programming concepts, front-end development and back-end development. I will publish all the related code on github.
